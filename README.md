Introduction
This repository contains the code and LaTeX files used to generate the results for our paper, Urinary Metabolomics and Machine Learning: A Novel Diagnostic and Grading Method for Canine Mammary Tumors.
This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-driven diagnostic model leveraging urinary metabolite profiling to classify malignant masses and assist in tumor grading. Using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we analyze 55 tumor-specific urinary metabolites from 156 dogs to develop accurate, non-invasive diagnostic tools.

Software Implementation
The analysis was conducted using Python within Jupyter notebooks.
Key Dependencies
pandas, numpy: Data preprocessing and manipulation
scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn: Machine learning model training and handling class imbalance
matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization
scipy: Scientific and technical computing
lifelines: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
jupyterlab: Interactive development environment

Acknowledgements
We acknowledge the support of veterinary oncologists and computational researchers who contributed to the dataset and model validation.
