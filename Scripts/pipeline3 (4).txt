To maintain an n/p ratio of ~10 given the small cohort, we used RFE to narrow the feature pool. UM + breed pool performed with slightly higher PR-AUC than UM alone, though breed was not selected as a top 5 feature (possibly due to high cardinality). A sensitivity analysis with age was performed, and performance held.
